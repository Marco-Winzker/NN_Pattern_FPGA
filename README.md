# NN_Pattern_FPGA
Neural Network for Pattern Recognition on an FPGA

In this project you learn to implement a neural network for pattern recognition on an FPGA. Video lectures explain training of the network and FPGA implementation with VHDL. The application is pattern recognition in video signals. The code is intended as an educational example.
